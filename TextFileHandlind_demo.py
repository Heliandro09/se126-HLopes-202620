#W2 - Text file Handling Intro Demo

#Step 1: import csv(comma separated value) library 
import csv

total_records = 0 #holds total num of recs in file 

#STEP 2: connect to file
#--connected to file-------------------------------
#include relative file path in open() - make sure to switch \ to /
with open("simple.csv") as csvfile:
    #make sure to indent inside of code block!

    #allow the csv reader to access and read the file
    file = csv.reader(csvfile)
    # file = entire data from file! organized as records:]

    #STEP 3 : process through every record (row) in the file 
    for record in file:
        #add +1 to total_records to keep accurate count
        total_records += 1 #total_ records = total_records + 1
        #print(record) #entire record/row data as a list


        name = record[0] #name field
        number = record[1] #number field
        color = record[2] #color field

    print(f"{name}'s number is {number} and they love the color {color}!")



#--disconnect from file----------------------------
print("----------------------------------------")
print(f"\nTOTAL RECORDS: {total_records}\n")
